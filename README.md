# Draconine

Currently, there is no decent weather forecasting program for the Windows desktop environment.  The Weather Channel does have one, but it's pretty large, a little flaky, and includes large advertisements.  This project is geared towards accomplishing the same goal but doing so in a smaller window with only the necessary information.

This program does use the Forecast API and does require an API key available from [https://pirate-weather.apiable.io/](https://pirate-weather.apiable.io/ "Pirate Weather").

[Download compiled versions here](https://kruug.org/draconemsoft/archive/desktopweather/).

## Installation

This is a "portable" program.  No installation required.  Unzip the files to a folder and run "Draconine.exe".  Ensure all of the files stay together and create shortcuts if wanted.

## Requirements

This program requires the .Net 4.5 run-time.  Download here: [http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30653](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30653)

[NewtonSoft.JSON](http://www.newtonsoft.com/json) is required if building from source.

## Usage

Currently, there is a constant available in the code for the API key.  You will have to get your own key if you build from source, but the pre-compiled binary has a key already enabled.
